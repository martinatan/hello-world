my name is martina and i'm finally doing a github tutorial
i've taken two classes of computer science so far and i'm comfortable with C++
but i'm hoping to learn more web development tools like JS, HTML/CSS/Java, and the like
i tried R once but it might take a while to find a reason to get back to that
next languages i want to learn are maybe Python and C
hope anyone reading this has a nice day!
